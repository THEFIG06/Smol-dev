1. HTML and CSS: Both "index.html" and "css/style.css" files share the HTML and CSS language dependency. HTML is used for structuring the content on the web page and CSS is used for styling these HTML elements.

2. Tailwind CSS: Both "index.html" and "css/tailwind.css" share the Tailwind CSS framework dependency. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is used for designing modern websites.

3. DOM Elements: The "index.html" file will contain all the DOM elements. These elements will have unique id names which will be used in the CSS files ("css/style.css" and "css/tailwind.css") for styling.

4. Class Names: The class names defined in the Tailwind CSS file ("css/tailwind.css") will be used in the HTML file ("index.html") to apply styles to the HTML elements.

5. Linking of CSS files: The CSS files ("css/style.css" and "css/tailwind.css") will be linked in the HTML file ("index.html") using the `<link>` tag.

6. Theme: The dark, clean, and simple theme will be a shared design dependency across all the files. The HTML structure will be designed keeping this theme in mind and the CSS files will contain styles to reflect this theme.
